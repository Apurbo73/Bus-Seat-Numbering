### Bus Seat Numbering

---

### ğŸ§  **Goal**:

Given a seat number (1 to 30), determine what type of seat it is:

* **Lower Single**
* **Lower Double**
* **Upper Single**
* **Upper Double**

---

### ğŸšŒ **Seat Layout Assumption**:

Since the image isn't available, we follow a **logical pattern** used in such problems:

#### ğŸ”» Lower Deck: Seats 1 to 15

* **Seats 1 to 10** â†’ `Lower Double` (double means two seats are side-by-side)
* **Seats 11 to 15** â†’ `Lower Single` (single seat, often next to the aisle or in the back corner)

#### ğŸ”º Upper Deck: Seats 16 to 30

* **Seats 16 to 25** â†’ `Upper Double`
* **Seats 26 to 30** â†’ `Upper Single`

This division ensures:

* 10 double seats per deck (2 seats Ã— 5 rows = 10)
* 5 single seats per deck

### ğŸ”¢ Sample Classification:

| Seat Number | Category     |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Lower Double |
| 12          | Lower Single |
| 24          | Upper Double |
| 30          | Upper Single |

---

### ğŸ”„ How the Code Works:

```cpp
string classifySeat(int seat) {
    if (seat >= 1 && seat <= 10)
        return "Lower Double";
    else if (seat >= 11 && seat <= 15)
        return "Lower Single";
    else if (seat >= 16 && seat <= 25)
        return "Upper Double";
    else if (seat >= 26 && seat <= 30)
        return "Upper Single";
    else
        return "Invalid Seat";
}
```

* It **checks** the range of the seat number:

  * If it's 1â€“10 â†’ it's a Lower Double
  * If it's 11â€“15 â†’ Lower Single
  * If it's 16â€“25 â†’ Upper Double
  * If it's 26â€“30 â†’ Upper Single
  * Otherwise â†’ "Invalid Seat" (in case someone enters a number outside 1â€“30)

Then it prints the category for each test case.
